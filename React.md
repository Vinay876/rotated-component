<!-- DEBOUNCING-->
There are some heavy tasks in software
development. Take calling an API, for
example. Suppose we have an API that
searches a list of users, and we can't
afford to fire it too often. We want to
search only when we have typed the
whole search query.

OR

In JavaScript, a debounce function makes
sure that your code is only triggered once
per user input. Search box suggestions,
text-field auto-saves, and eliminating
double-button clicks are all use cases for
debounce.
